# GDP Data Analysis
An exploratory data analysis of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on different countries.

# Purpose
I was curious about GDP (Domestic Gross Product) of every country and its relationship with political parties. I wanted to start by analyzing Mexico and the U.S and analyze how they compare to the rest of the world.
It is a fact that GDP on its own is NOT correlated with political parties but i wanted to verify the data on my own.

## The actual value of GDP is not as important as the rate of change of GDP (GDP'). How does the rate of change look like for every country?
## Mexico has a new president every 6 years. What's the correlation between presidents and GDP'?
## Whats the correlation between political party and GDP' in the U.S?
## How does Mexico and the U.S compare against the rest of the world?


The data exploration process is hosted in a jupyter notebook [here](/gdp_clean.ipynb)
