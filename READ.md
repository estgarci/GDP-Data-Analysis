# GDP Data analysis

# Purpose
I was curious about GDP (Domestic Gross Product) of every country and its relationship with political parties. I wanted to start by analyzing Mexico and the U.S.
It is a fact that GDP on its own is NOT correlated with political parties but i wanted to verify the data on my own.
